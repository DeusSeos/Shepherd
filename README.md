## Getting Started

> **Note:** Project is in early development. Expect rapid iteration and breaking changes.

### Prerequisites

- Rust (1.83 or higher recommended)
- Access to a Rancher environment with API token

### Usage

To output logs make sure to set the environment variable `RUST_LOG=none,shepherd=LOG_LEVEL` where `LOG_LEVEL` is of (`DEBUG`|`TRACE`|`INFO`)

Set the config for shepherd at `~/.shepherd/config.toml`

Example:

```toml
rancher_config_path = "/Users/samuel/Documents/Kubernetes/rancher_config"
endpoint_url = "https://rancher.rd.localhost"
file_format = "json"
token = "token-kdlz3:random312random312random312r"
remote_git_url = "git@github.com:samuel/remote_config_store.git"
cluster_names = ["cluster1", "cluster2"]
# in seconds
loop_interval = 60
# in milliseconds
retry_delay = 500
branch = "main"

[auth_method]
SshKey = "/Users/samuel/.ssh/shepherd"
```
